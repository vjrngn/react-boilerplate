## React Boilerplate
Simple boilerplate to get up and running quickly. This does not make any assumptions about your app
other than the webpack config and having different folders for components and views

*Components* are individual pices of UI while *Views* are UI that are made up of those individual components.

    git clone https://github.com/vjrngn/react-boilerplate.git my-app
    cd my-app && npm install
